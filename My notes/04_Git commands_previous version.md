# This is to see how we can view or switch to the previous versionS of the code

# [git checkout "commit hash"]

commit hash is the commit id which you will see when you do a commit

# [git log] > This only shows the current current commit and all the commits behind the current commit. But not any commits infront of it.

# [git log --all] > This will shows all the versions of our commit.

# {Head} in the git log shows which version we are currently viewing.

# {Master/main} - always points to the latest commit to the branch.

if you trying to access the main branch just do [git checkout main]
