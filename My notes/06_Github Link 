In order to add a link from our local repo to our remote repository on Git hub, we use

# [git remote add origin "repo url from github"]

To check if the link rom our local repo to our remote repository has been made, we use

# [git remote] - shows just the name [origin], but if we need more details of the link, we use,

# [git remote -v] - this will give the repo Url

If we want to remove the link of remote repo from our local repo, we use

# [git remote remove origin]

Note:
Upload to github = Push
Download from Github = Pull

# To push our changes to Github repo, we need to give the creddentails of the person who created it.

# [git config --global credential.username "NavHoratti"]

Now to push, we need to give remote repository name [origin] and to which branch of commits that we are going to push. [because when we push we do not pus entire commit history, but instead we only push one branch of commits at a time ]

# [git push origin main]

Then it will ask you the password, just give the token you have generated, from settings > Developer settings> Personal access tokens> Tokens (classic).

# Once you push the code from locl repo to the GitHub, then if you do [git log --all --graph],you will see [HEAD -> main, origin/main]. Origin/main means now GitHub is now idetical to our local branch.

# [git push origin main --set-upstream] - short form for pushing our code to main branch, so that next time yu only need to type [git push].

# [Note] - [git push origin main] command only push the commits to GitHub.
