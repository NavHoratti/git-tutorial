In order to add a link from our local repo to our remote repository on Git hub, we use

# [git remote add origin "repo url from github"]

To check if the link rom our local repo to our remote repository has been made, we use

# [git remote] - shows just the name [origin], but if we need more details of the link, we use,

# [git remote -v] - this will give the repo Url

If we want to remove the link of remote repo from our local repo, we use

# [git remote remove origin]

Note:
Upload to github = Push
Download from Github = Pull
